To build Jinet VMM you need patience.

Also you need [disk.img](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mm_deZUjCQul9x6At3O8XDpfRAmz4tmm/view?usp=sharing). I wish I could provide with a script to compile this nearly fully empty disk with grub-preinstalled, but I can't at the moment.

You also need `gcc`, `binutils` and `fasm`.

Make it: `make clean all pack`

You're

immaculate,

rational,

perfect.
